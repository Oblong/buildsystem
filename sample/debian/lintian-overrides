# Add lintian overrides here. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE try to fix the issues lintian
# is complaining about instead of just silencing the complaints here. The
# overrides are just for false positives. The following three overrides are
# generally desired.

# my sonames are libBlah, but package names are liboblong-blah. So I silence lintian here
package-name-doesnt-match-sonames

# I'm using section 'oblong' for my packages, so it's ok if lintian doesn't know about it
unknown-section

# Not a problem that debconf messages are only available in English
